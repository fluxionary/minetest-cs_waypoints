minetest CSM which implements waypoints on top of the /teleport server side command.

requirements
------------

tested with minetest 0.4.17 and 5.0.

in 5.0, the server *must* have send_chat_message enabled, which is not the default.

additionally, this mod will *only* work if your account has the "teleport" privilege.
it will *not* let ordinary users teleport, unless that is a default privilege.

installation
------------

make sure the mod is installed at `~/.minetest/clientmods/cs_waypoints`

make sure `~/.minetest/clientmods/mods.conf` exists and contains:

```
load_mod_cs_waypoints = true
```

usage
-----

* .wp_set NAME: set a waypoint at your current location
* .wp_unset NAME: remove a waypoint
* .wp_list: list all waypoints
* .tw NAME: teleport to a waypoint
* .tw PLAYERNAME WAYPOINT_NAME: teleport another player to a waypoint
* .tr: teleport to a random location
* .tr ELEVATION: teleport to a random location at a given elevation (y value)
